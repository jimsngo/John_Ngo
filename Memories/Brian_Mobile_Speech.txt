üèà FOR MY LITTLE BROTHER HAI
A Memory from Brian Ngo

1980 - Immaculate Elementary School, Tulsa

Hai was in 7th grade, I was in 8th. We played football together.

One day after practice, four older boys confronted us, looking for a fight. I wanted to avoid trouble, but Hai stepped forward with no fear and said, "Let me talk to them."

They attacked him - punches to his face and stomach, knocking him down, all four jumping on him. I immediately jumped in to help my brother.

After the fight ended and we talked, we discovered it was all a misunderstanding about a girl named Missy. All six of us became friends that day.

WHAT I'LL NEVER FORGET:
‚Ä¢ Hai showed no fear, even outnumbered 4 to 2
‚Ä¢ He stood up to protect what mattered  
‚Ä¢ He turned enemies into friends
‚Ä¢ He was always my brave little brother

Today when Lily and Logan call me "B Th·∫Øng," I feel like they're calling their father. Hai's fearless, loving spirit lives on in them.

That day I saw who Hai really was - and those same qualities made him the devoted husband, loving father, and loyal brother we're celebrating today.

I love you, Hai. I will carry your name in my heart forever.
