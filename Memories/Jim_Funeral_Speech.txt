this is my memory of my younger brother Hai
I got to spend a lot of time lately during Hai's treatment, hospital stays, and his last days.
My focus today is how he was eager to fight, recover, and return to work.
Disappointed? yes, did not want to beleive it? yes, and willing fight it? yes, because he his family needs him.

It began with a colonoscopy, and a diagnosed of the cancer, then a small surgery then chemo. Hai called his employer and said" I'll be back next week".
A few weeks later, he called and told his employer, "I'll be back next month".
Always telling me that he will be ok, and that he will go back to work.

I was with him many days recently, after his surgeries, rehab, making small progress, but determined to walk again and return to work.
He kept on working hard with rehab, not knowing that his body was already broken inside little by little.

I remwmber hai as a hard working person, 12 hours a day, 6 days a week is what he has been doing more than 20 years, to support his family.
Even at his weakest, he was still thinking about working to provide for his family.
