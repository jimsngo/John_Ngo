This is from Chu Thang (Brian Ngo)

1980.  At Immaculate School in Tulsa Oklahoma.
I was an 8th grader and my little brother was in 7th grade.
We joined the Jr Football team at Immaculate School.
One day after practice, and everyone had gone home, John and I was walking home.  suddenly 4 guys approached us.  One of them wanted to fight with Hai (John).  I refused, but Hai told me, he can handled it.  So I allowed Hai to deal with one guy.  One on One.  
My brother started out like a boxer with kungfu experience.  I dont remember much, but my brother was brave.  No fear. But suddenly Hai fell to the ground and the other guy jump on top of him.  I saw Hai took 2 punches.  One to the stomach and the other straight in the face while on the ground.  I immediately jumped in and tackled the guy away from my brother Hai.  
Now its 4 on 2.  Anyway after a few punches and kicks, we all stand and started to talk.  As we talked it turned out a guy was mad because Hai kept talking to Missy.  One of the girl at school who liked him.  But after we talked, all 6 of us became friends, we shook hands, and became best of friends.  We promised we will stick togethter, and not let misunderstanding get in the way of our new friendship.

After the fight, Hai told me, he slipped when he tried to kick the other guy.  

I love my little brother for standing up.  Not fear because we were outnumbered (4 to 2).  He was, and always be my little brother.  And I missed him so much.  I will carry his name in my name for the rest of my life.  For some odd reason, when Lily or Logan call me "B thang" I feel as if they were calling their father.
