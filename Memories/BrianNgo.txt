This is from Chu Thang (Brian Ngo)

1980.  At Immaculate Elementary School in Tulsa Oklahoma.
I was an 8th grader and my little brother Hai was in 7th grade.
We joined the Jr Football team at Immaculate School.

One day after practice, and everyone had gone home, John and I was walking home.  suddenly 4 guys approached us.  For some unknow reasons, One of them started to harras us and wanted to pick fight with us.  I refused the confrontation, but Hai, showing no fear, told me: "let me talk to them". Before you know it, the 4 guys started throwing punches at my brother Hai, I remember one to the face and one to the stomach, knocking him to the ground, then they quickly jump on top of him while he was on the ground. 
I immediately jumped in and tackled the guy away from my brother Hai.  
Anyway after a few more punches and kicks, we all stop and started talking.  As we talked it turned out a guy was mad because Hai kept talking to Missy.  believe or not, all 6 of us became friends afterward, we shook hands, and became best of friends.  We promised we will stick togethter, and not let misunderstanding get in the way of our new friendship.

Hai told me that he slipped when he tried to kick the other guy, but I know he had no chance with 4 bigger boys.  

I love my little brother for standing up.  Not fear because we were outnumbered (4 to 2).  He was, and always be my little brother.  And I missed him so much.  I will carry his name in my name for the rest of my life.  For some odd reason, when Lily or Logan call me "B thang" I feel as if they were calling their father.
