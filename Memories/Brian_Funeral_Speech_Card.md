### **The Day My Little Brother Showed His Heart**
*Immaculate Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma - 1980*

I was in 8th grade, Hai was in 7th. We both played on the junior football team at Immaculate School - two brothers who had each other's backs.

One afternoon after practice, when everyone else had gone home, Hai and I were walking together. Suddenly, four older boys approached us. For reasons we didn't understand, one of them started harassing us, looking for a fight.

I tried to avoid the confrontation, but my little brother Hai? He showed no fear. He looked at me and said, **"Let me talk to them."**

Before I knew it, those four boys were throwing punches at Hai - one to his face, one to his stomach, knocking him to the ground. Then they all jumped on him while he was down.

**I immediately jumped in and tackled them off my brother.**

After more punches and kicks were exchanged, we all finally stopped and started talking. It turned out one of the boys was upset because Hai had been talking to a girl named Missy. 

**Here's the amazing part:** All six of us became friends that day. We shook hands and promised to stick together, not letting misunderstandings get in the way of friendship.

Later, Hai told me he had slipped when he tried to kick back, but I knew the truth - he had no real chance against four bigger boys. **That didn't matter to him.**

### **What This Memory Means**

I loved my little brother for standing up that day. He showed no fear, even though we were outnumbered 4 to 2. **He was brave, he was protective, and he was always my little brother.**

Today, when Lily or Logan call me "B Th·∫Øng," I feel as if they're calling their father. Hai's spirit lives on in his children, in his family, in all of us who loved him.

**I will carry his name in my heart for the rest of my life.**

*That day at Immaculate School, I saw who Hai really was - fearless in the face of challenge, loyal to family, and someone who could turn enemies into friends. Those same qualities defined him his entire life as a devoted husband, loving father, and cherished brother.*

**I miss you, Hai. You were, and always will be, my little brother.** üíô
