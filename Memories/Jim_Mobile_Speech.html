            <div class="section-title">The Heart of a Warrior, The Soul of a Provider</div>
            <div class="story">
                During these past months, I've been blessed to spend countless hours with my younger brother Hai - through his treatments, hospital stays, and his final days with us. Today, I want to share what I witnessed: a man whose love for his family burned so bright that even illness couldn't dim his determination to provide for them.

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">"I'll Be Back Next Week"</div>
            <div class="story">
                It started with a colonoscopy and a cancer diagnosis. Then came the surgery, followed by chemotherapy. But here's what amazed me about Hai - after that first small surgery, he called his employer and said with unwavering confidence:
            </div>
            <div class="quote">"I'll be back next week."</div>
            <div class="story">
                A few weeks later, as treatments continued, he called again: <strong>"I'll be back next month."</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                And to me, his big brother, he would always say with that gentle smile of his, <strong>"I'll be okay, Jim. I'm going back to work."</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                He wasn't just talking about a job - he was talking about his mission, his purpose, his way of saying "I love you" to Hien, Lily, and Logan every single day.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">The Strength I'll Never Forget</div>
            <div class="story">
                I was privileged to be by his side through surgeries, rehabilitation sessions, and those small but precious moments of progress. Even when his body was fighting the battle of his life, Hai was determined to walk again, to get strong again, <strong>to work again.</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                Day after day, I watched him push through rehab with a fierce determination that took my breath away. He worked so hard, not knowing that his beautiful, generous heart was quietly breaking down inside. But his spirit? His spirit was unbreakable.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Twenty Years of Love in Action</div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Twelve hours a day, six days a week</strong> - that wasn't just his work schedule, that was his love letter to his family written in sweat and sacrifice.
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                Even in his weakest moments, when his body could barely stand, his mind was still on providing for Hien, Lily, and Logan. That's who Hai was - a man who measured his worth not in what he could receive, but in what he could give.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Forever My Little Brother</div>
            <div class="story">
                Hai showed us that true strength isn't measured in pounds lifted or miles run - it's measured in the depth of love that drives you to keep going when everything else says stop.
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                Even now, as I miss him more than words can express, I'm inspired by the man he was: <strong>unwavering in his dedication, limitless in his love, and absolutely devoted to the people who meant everything to him.</strong>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="closing">
            <strong>Hai, you fought with the heart of a warrior and loved with the soul of a saint. You were the best of us, little brother. And we will carry your beautiful example of love, dedication, and family devotion in our hearts forever.</strong>
            <br><br>
            <em>Rest in peace, my beloved brother. Your work here is done, and it was beautiful.</em>
